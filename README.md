# Coop (traffic system simulation)

## What's the project about?

The project's about simulation of traffic system in different sities (Sities' layouts were imported through osmnx). Model of the traffic system was based on research "Modeling and simulation of highway traffic using a cellular automaton approach" by Ding Ding. We've used Microscopic traffic model (car-following model), because this approach enabled us to visualize the cars and traffic itself. 

## Where that project was presented?

It was presented on TUI team competition regional stage, and we actually won it. Unfortunately, we weren't able to present it on national stage, due to global invasion on Ukraine. 

## On what we stopped?

We stopped on creating 3D simulation of the traffic system, and using ML algorithms to optimize the traffic system of the site, that we're viewing.


## How to run it?

Start using "python3 project.py"

Requirements:
  Python:
    osmnx,
    numpy
  
  Js:
    node.js


Commands:
"quit" - for quitting
"set" - for initiating scripts [CarDriver, PortDriver, ...]
"setMap" - for getting map into site, which created by server
...

All of them must be typed in terminal (or the place that the programm is running)
